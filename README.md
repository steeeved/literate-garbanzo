# SQLite Questions

This repository contains a set of SQL commands that can be used to create a table, insert data into that table, and select data from that table in SQLite.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary software installed on your computer, including SQLite and a code editor that supports SQLite.

## Usage

1. Create a new SQLite database by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and typing "SQLite: New Database" and then select the folder where you want to create the database and give it a name.

2. Once the database is created, open the database by right-clicking on the database file in the Explorer and selecting "SQLite: Open Database."

3. You can now run SQL commands by opening a new SQL file and running the commands in that file or use the SQLite: Execute command in the editor.

4. The results of your queries will be displayed in the Output pane.

5. You can also use the SQLite: Manage Connection option to connect to the database and SQLite: Manage Table option to create, edit, and delete tables.

6. You should replace the values in the 'VALUES' clause with your own data and also replace the table name with the table name you have created.

7. Also, you may need to modify the data types of the columns as per the requirement of your data.

8. Also, you may need to modify the constraint on the columns as per the requirement of your data.

9. Also, you may need to modify the connection to your specific database.

## Attention

- Please make sure that you test your commands in a safe environment and make backups of your data before making any changes.
- It is a good practice to use test data instead of real data on this kind of online tools, and also, be sure to check the terms of service and privacy policies of these resources before using them.
